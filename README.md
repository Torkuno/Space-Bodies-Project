# **Asteroid Orbit Visualization Project**

This project visualizes the orbit of near-Earth objects (NEOs) around Earth using data fetched from NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs). It simulates the elliptical orbit of an asteroid and allows you to interact with the orbit using a slider to adjust the time elapsed during the orbit.

## **Project Structure**

- **main.cpp**: Contains the main logic to fetch data, compute asteroid orbits, and render the visualization using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
- **src/get_data.cpp / get_data.h**: Manages fetching NEO data from NASA's API using cURL.
- **json.hpp**: Header-only library to handle JSON data.
- **earth_image.png**: Image used as the texture for the Earth in the visualization.
- **.vscode**: Contains configuration files for compiling and running the code within Visual Studio Code.

## **Installation Guide**

### 1. **Install Dependencies**

To successfully compile and run this project, you need to install several dependencies, including `SFML`, `cURL`, and `nlohmann-json`.

- **On MinGW** (Windows):
    - Install cURL:
      ```bash
      pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-curl
      ```
    - Install nlohmann-json:
      ```bash
      pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-nlohmann-json
      ```

- **On macOS**:
    - Install Homebrew if you havenâ€™t already:
      ```bash
      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      ```
    - Install SFML and cURL:
      ```bash
      brew install sfml curl
      ```
    - Install nlohmann-json:
      ```bash
      brew install nlohmann-json
      ```

### 2. **Configure Visual Studio Code**

This project is configured to be compiled and run from VSCode. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Open **VSCode** and go to **Settings** (Ctrl + ,).
2. Search for `include path`.
3. Scroll down to the **Include Path** section and press `Add Item`.
4. Add the following address:

  _Windows_
   ```
   C:\msys64\mingw64\include
   ```
_MacOS_
   ```
   /opt/homebrew/include
   ```
5. Now, you can compile the code using the VSCode's configuration.

### 3. Get NASA API Key
To complete this step and be able to use this program visit [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and get your API key. Once done, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following line:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## **Running the Application**

### **Run the Main Application**

To run the near-Earth object analyzer, you have the following options:

- You can build and run the app directly from VSCode.

- You can build the app with CMake.

- You can build and run the app from the command line.

Use the following commands if you decide to build the app from the command line:

_Windows_
```bash
g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -g main.cpp src/get_data.cpp -o neo_analyzer.exe -lcurl -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```
```
neo_analyzer.exe
```

_MacOS_
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp src/get_data.cpp -o neo_analyzer -I/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml/include -L/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lcurl
```
```
./neo_analyzer
```

Alternatively, to build the project using CMake, follow these steps:

### **Install CMake**

Ensure you have CMake installed on your system. You can download it from [CMake's official website](https://cmake.org/download/) or install it via a package manager.

- **On Windows**:
  - Download and install CMake from the [official website](https://cmake.org/download/).

- **On macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install cmake
  ```

- **On Linux**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install cmake
  ```

### **Build the project**

  **Create a build directory:**
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```

  **Run CMake to generate build files:**
  ```bash
  cmake ..
  ```

  **Build the project:**
  ```bash
  cmake --build .
  ```

  **Run the Application**

  After building the project, you can now run the application:

  - **On Windows**
  ```bash
  ./NEOAnalyzer.exe
  ```

  - **On MacOS / Linux**
  ```bash
  ./NEOAnalyzer
  ```

### **Running Tests (Optional)**

If you have unit tests written for the project using Google Test (`gtest`), you can go to googletest branch

### Memory Leak Analysis

As part of the development process, memory leaks tests were conducted. The analysis was performed using `leaks` (tool compatible on macOS). Here are the results of the test:
  - Tool Used: /usr/bin/leaks
  - Platform: macOS (Version 15.1.1, Build 24B91)
  - Architecture: ARM64
  - **Results**:
    - Nodes Allocated: 2,525 (totaling 397 KB)
    - Memory Leaks Found: 0
    - Total Leaked Bytes: 0

The **absence of memory leaks** confirms that the application efficiently manages memory and is free from issues related to memory allocation and deallocation.


## **Features**

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the asteroid orbit around Earth using a dynamic slider to control time elapsed.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetches real-time data of Near-Earth Objects from NASA's NeoWs API.
- **Elliptical Orbit Simulation**: Simulates elliptical orbits around Earth using astrodynamics calculations.

## **How It Works**

1. **Fetch Asteroid Data**: The application fetches a list of NEOs for a selected date from NASA's API.
2. **Select Asteroid**: You can select which asteroid to visualize.
3. **Orbit Calculation**: The asteroid's orbit is calculated based on its close approach distance, velocity, and other parameters.
4. **Visualize Orbit**: The orbit is displayed with Earth at the center, and the user can control the asteroid's position using the slider.

## **Technologies Used**

- **SFML**: For graphics and window handling.
- **cURL**: To fetch data from NASA's API.
- **nlohmann-json**: To parse JSON data from the API.
- **Google Test (Optional)**: For unit testing (if applicable).
